# python-explore-libraries

This project is a collection of python libraries for exploring the workings of the python ecosystem.

Highly opinionated libraries are included, but the goal is to provide a collection of libraries that are useful for exploring the python ecosystem.

If you like it, please give a :star: and share it with your friends!

P.S. I'm not a python developer, but I'm a big fan of python. Contributions are always welcome!
